# 📖 About the Project <a name="about-project"></a>

**AI-Driven Impact Measurement & Early Warning System for Refugee-Led Microenterprises** is an end-to-end decision-support platform designed to help Inkomoko proactively identify vulnerable refugee- and host-community-owned businesses, measure program impact, and support data-driven intervention planning.

The system combines **impact measurement**, **predictive risk modeling**, and **interactive dashboards** to provide actionable insights at the **client**, **portfolio**, and **country** levels.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals <a name="project-goals"></a>

* Track key impact indicators such as income growth, business survival, job creation, and access to finance
* Predict enterprise-level distress or default with early warning lead time
* Support program teams in prioritizing interventions
* Enable organizational learning through portfolio-level analytics
* Provide a scalable and interpretable AI solution suitable for fragile contexts

---

## 🧠 System Overview <a name="system-overview"></a>

The platform consists of:

* A **Flask-based backend** for data access, feature processing, and model inference
* A **Next.js + Tailwind CSS frontend** for dashboards and role-based user interaction
* **Machine learning models** trained concurrently with UI/API development
* A modular design allowing dummy data to be replaced seamlessly with real data

# 🏗 Architecture & Development Strategy <a name="architecture"></a>

To ensure timely delivery and reduce integration risk, the project follows a **parallel development approach**:

* **Model development** (feature engineering, baseline models, evaluation)
* **Backend API development** (Flask inference endpoints)
* **Frontend dashboard development** (Next.js UI with dummy data)

These components are developed **concurrently**, with final stages focused on **integration**, validation, and refinement.

This approach ensures:

* Early visualization of expected outputs
* Clear contracts between data, models, and UI
* Faster iteration and reduced last-stage risk
